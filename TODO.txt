- [game] Implement UI control sizing customizability
- [game & controller] Implement game success & failure
         Part 1: proprietary implementation for client
            Trivia:
                - show image for a few seconds then go to next question
                - final question sho
            Implementation:
                - If launching from auto (handled by controller):
                    - Load the question
                    - On success, invoke a Success event
                    - When success timer runs out, invoke a Loading event and load the next question in the background from the controller
                    - Instantiate the SuccessImage and SuccessText when calling Success
            Part 2: proper implementation
                - Along with the above option, add regular Success and Fail sequences. (customization, with auto in mind)
- [game & controller] Implement automating the game with customizations
- [all] Code cleanup (?)
